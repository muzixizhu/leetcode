# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#
# Example:
# Given a binary tree
#           1
#          / \
#         2   3
#        / \
#       4   5
# Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
#
# Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self._maxsum = 1
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            L = dfs(node.left)
            R = dfs(node.right)
            self._maxsum = max(self._maxsum, L+R+1)
            return max(L, R) + 1
        dfs(root)
        return self._maxsum -1
